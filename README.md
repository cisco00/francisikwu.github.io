## Projects
### Analysis on student performance based on geographical location
  - Analyses student performance using historical data of past student aavailable in the database to uncover why student(natives) from certain region strugle and finding it difficult to complete the one year programm using python and Power BI 

### Sentiment Analysis
![](/assets/img/sentimentAnalysis.png)
  - Developed a sentiment analysis model for analysing different political party candidate tweets during the 2022 Nigeria general election using feeds from twitter API. This help the political party to know region to focus on more given   them a sense of strategy to implore in certain region of the country and approach to use.

### Crop Rotation Recommendation Engine
![](/assets/img/recommendation.jpeg)
  - developed a recommendation engine for crop recommendations in the agricultural sector using Python. This engine utilized historical and geospatial data to provide tailored recommendations to farmers across different regions of Nigeria, optimizing crop selection and increasing farm yield.

### Stock Market Prediction
  -  Developed a predictive model using python and sklearn machine learning framework, to predict the closing price of NYSC stocks using yahoo stock API.

### Quantifying-monetary-savings-through-preventative-work
 - Developed an interactive machine learning model using python and streamlite framework That shows the financial savings and preventive measures set in place by the role of community connectors and social workers. This will help to predict the value of preventive measures and how quantitative monetary estimation can be used to make more informed decisions.
